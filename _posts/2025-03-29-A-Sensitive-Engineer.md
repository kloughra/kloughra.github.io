A Sensitive Person
----------
Despite spending time in my younger years trying to convince myself and others that I was not, I now identify as a sensitive person.

When I say sensitive, I mean I have observesd that I have a heightened (compared to some) sensitivity to sensory input, other's emotions, and my surroundings.

I had always been 'called senstive' growing up, but I never identified that way. My humorous realization of my sensitivity was a conversation with a loved one. I thought I was pointing out something about him, but I ended up learning more about me. 

I asked "When you walk on to a crowded metro, don't you automatically start analyzing; who is on the train, where does it look like they are going, how is where I am standing making them feel, how could I adjust to make everyone feel more comfortable, wow that guy is being really inconsiderate to that lady over there, I can tell she's frustrated.. on and on and on..?" I'll never forget the look of shock on his face as he said, "Holy shit, no. Do you?". We both had a very good laugh about how differently we experienced the world. 

While I used to shy away from this word when I was younger, because I did not want to be associated to the common connotation that sometimes comes with it - needy, weak, ineffective, feminine (haha, yes. even feminine) etc, I have learned to embrace being sensitive and see the unique competency that comes with it.
 
- Being sensitive, I love physical movement. I have always loved physical challenges, contact sports, dancing, hiking, and the like.

- I am an empath. As empathizing with others comes fairly naturally to me, I prefer being a team player. I work and play very well with others.

- I often pick up on nuances in social situations that help me understand and navigate them. I often can point out when people are talking past eachother without understanding eachother. I typically can translate and bridge communication gaps.

- I am energized by nature and beauty; a beautiful sunset changes my whole day.

- Listening to music is really stiumulating and enjoyable.

- I enjoy being around animals, and I find their communication and body langauge intuitive and easy to be around. 

Tradeoffs that Come with Being Sensitive
----------
While being sensitive can be a superpower, it takes energy. This energy suck creates some tradeoffs:
- As being in social situations takes so much energy, I need more alone/down time to recharge and process.

- Public speaking can be very overwhelming - I find it difficult not to sense and try to analyze others' reactions, moods, and feelings. When there is a larger number of people, those number of inputs become more than I can comforably handle.

- I find social manipulation and politics in friend groups and in the workplace very exhausting, and can tend towards to avoidance instead of confrontaton in those situations.

- On camera virtual calls are very stimulating, as it feels like someone is 10 inches from my face.

- As I am likely to sense others moods, I have a harder time keeping cool and am more likely to be excitable when things get heated.
