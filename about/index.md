Hello!

My name is Katie.

I have started, written, and never published so many blogs and posts over the years. 

However, in my 30s, I am finally reaching a spot where I carry much less of the burden of feeling the need to show up perfectly in public spaces and much more trust in my self and my worthiness to show up imperfectly in those spaces.

A Git blog isn't exactly a dramatic entry. But source control is my metaphorical home town.

I have been a software engineer for the past 10 years, and perhaps all I have to show on my public Github is a few college projects and some Advent coding challenges (despite not being religious (I find this humorous)), but I have spent so much of my career learning and building in this space.

I figure it's a better place than any other to put my misc thoughts - for anyone - or for no one - who cares - to read.

As the Godmother, Dr Brene Brown, preaches:

“Authenticity is a collection of choices that we have to make every day. It's about the choice to show up and be real. The choice to be honest. The choice to let our true selves be seen.”
― Brene Brown, The Gifts of Imperfection
